# Mathematical Summary Report (LaTeX)

This project contains a LaTeX-based academic report summarizing selected chapters from two influential mathematics books:

- ðŸ“˜ *Euler: The Master of Us All* by William Dunham  
- ðŸ“˜ *Mathematics and Its History* by John Stillwell  

The report was created as part of the **"Writing and Presenting Mathematics"** course at **IIT Hyderabad**, focusing on typesetting mathematical ideas with clarity and academic precision.
