# Mathematical Summary Report (LaTeX)

This repository contains a LaTeX-based academic report summarizing selected chapters from two influential mathematics books:

- ðŸ“˜ *Euler: The Master of Us All* by William Dunham  
- ðŸ“˜ *Mathematics and Its History* by John Stillwell  

The report was prepared as part of the **"Writing and Presenting Mathematics"** course at **IIT Hyderabad**, with a focus on clearly typesetting mathematical ideas and presenting them with academic rigor.
